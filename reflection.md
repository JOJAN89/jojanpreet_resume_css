# What does my code do?

My code creates a simple personal resume web page using HTML. It displays my name, photo, job title, a short bio, skills, experience, and contact information. It also includes a small SVG graphic (a green circle with initials "JK") and a link to my Instagram.

# What was my coding process?

I structured the page using HTML elements like <section>, <nav>, and <footer>. I added an image, SVG graphic, and few links.

# What challenges did I face?

Adding the SVG was something different and hard .

# What would I do differently now?

Fix repeated content and check for spelling and grammar.
Make the contact links easily accesible .
