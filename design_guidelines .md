# Colour Scheme

I selected 3 complementary colours to give my resume a clean, professional, and approachable look:

Primary (Blue #1E90FF): Used for headings, highlights, and links..

Secondary (Gray #444444): Used for text to ensure readability and a neutral balance.

Accent (Light Gray #F5F5F5): Used for backgrounds and section dividers, giving the page breathing room.


# Typography

I chose Google Fonts to ensure readability across devices:

Headings: Montserrat (Sans-serif) → clean, modern, and bold for section titles.

Body Text: Open Sans (Sans-serif) → highly readable for paragraphs and longer content.

Fallback: Arial, sans-serif in case Google Fonts fail to load.

This pairing balances strong headings with easy-to-read body text.

# Layout Principles

Grid-based layout: Content is aligned in structured sections (Header, About, Skills, Experience, Education, Projects).

White space: Adequate spacing between sections improves readability.

Consistency: Each section follows the same pattern (title, content), keeping the design predictable and professional.
